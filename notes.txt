for game
camera view port
2-20-21
if the tiles are in the viewport, load them, now a decision must be made
do the tiles loaded outside the viewport disappear, or do they simply stay loaded?
it may be better for performance for them to stay there, instead of deleting them and reloading them.
though im not sure how to tell if the tiles are within the viewport.
maybe the best way would be to simply use the canvas's translate functions.
OKAY NEw GAME PLAN
yes, generate the WHOLE map T_T, then, just trasnalte, i mean, i think i can find a way to keep my origanal movment code and collisions.

OKAY HERE'S THE PLAN
fix the arrays (in progress)
merge the arrays into one giant one
should i just draw them all in one big array? possibly
or i keep them as the separate 10 by 10 chunks and merge them into the giant one
this will depend on whether or not i can figure out how to merge the arrays
IF I CAN NOT
make one big array
IF I CAN
then merge them and continue
CONTINUING
draw the whole damn array
hopefully only once i need to, otherwise it'll be a real downer for peformance
transalate the image so only the desired area is being shown in the canvas viewport
make functions so the transalte is relative to the player position
but, maybe it should be trasnalted when the player moves
MISSON COMPLETE :D :D :D
